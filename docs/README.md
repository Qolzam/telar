# Telar Platform Documentation

    This documentation is currently under active development as we complete the platform-wide migration to our new, unified architecture, outlined in the main project README.

    Our goal is to provide comprehensive guides for:
    *   **Development:** Setting up a local environment and contributing to the platform.
    *   **Deployment:** Guides for deploying on Docker, Kubernetes, and other platforms.
    *   **API Reference:** A complete reference for the Telar Headless API and the AI Engine.

    This documentation will become the official source of truth for the project upon public launch.
