## 🚀 What is Telar?

Building community features from scratch is incredibly complex. Telar is a complete, **production-ready platform** that provides all the core functionality you need, allowing you to bypass months of development and focus on what makes your community unique.

It's a single, unified monorepo built on a modern, high-performance stack, designed for developers who value speed, flexibility, and the trust of open-source.

| Feature                      | The Telar Platform                                                         | The Old Way                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unified Platform**         | ✅ A complete, integrated solution in one repository.                        | ❌ Gluing together dozens of libraries for auth, profiles, posts, etc.      |
| **AI-Powered**               | ✅ Core features for moderation, engagement, and search built-in.            | ❌ Writing complex AI integrations from scratch.                            |
| **High-Performance Backend** | ✅ Modern, scalable Go backend using a professional "Vertical Slice" architecture. | ❌ Older, monolithic frameworks (Rails, PHP) or slow serverless functions.  |
| **Open Source (MIT)**        | ✅ 100% transparent, flexible, and free. No vendor lock-in.                 | ❌ Opaque, restrictive, and expensive closed-source SaaS platforms.         |
| **Flexible Architecture**    | ✅ Deploy as a single "modular monolith" or as true microservices on Kubernetes. | ❌ Locked into a single deployment model that can't scale with you. |

## 🤖 The AI-Powered Advantage

Telar is designed from the ground up to leverage AI, solving the most painful problems of community management.

*   **💡 Community Ignition Toolkit:** Solves the "empty room" problem with AI-powered conversation starters and automated weekly summaries.

*   **🛡️ AI Co-Moderator:** Solves the "toxicity & trolls" problem with a 24/7 AI assistant that uses sentiment and intent analysis to proactively flag harmful content.

*   **⚡ Content Supercharger:** Solves the "buried knowledge" problem with a RAG-based AI search that understands natural language, allowing users to ask questions and get synthesized answers with sources.

Underpinning these features is a **standalone, provider-agnostic AI engine**, designed to be flexible, cost-effective, and powerful. It can run on anything from local, open-source models to high-performance inference APIs.

## 🏁 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Our platform is being architected to run entirely on Docker for a seamless developer experience. The full `docker-compose` setup is a primary goal of the current refactor.


**Prerequisites:** Docker & Docker Compose

```bash
# NOTE: The full docker-compose setup is in progress. This is the target command.

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qolzam/telar.git

# 2. Navigate into the directory
cd telar

# 3. Start the entire platform
docker-compose up
```

Your Telar instance is now running!
*   **API:** `http://localhost:8080`
*   **Web App:** `http://localhost:3000`

For more detailed setup and configuration, please see our [**Full Documentation**](./docs/README.md).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Telar is built on a modern, robust, and scalable set of technologies chosen for performance and developer experience.

*   **Backend:** Go (Golang)
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (with JSONB)
*   **Vector Database:** Weaviate
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes
*   **AI Engine:** A provider-agnostic service supporting:
    *   **Ollama:** For free, private, self-hosted open-source models.
    *   **Groq:** For high-performance, low-latency cloud inference.
    *   **OpenAI:** For compatibility with the standard commercial API.
